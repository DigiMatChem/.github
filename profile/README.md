## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a collection of repositories of the Division ["Digital Materials Chemistry"](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/About-us/Organisation/President/Department-6/Division-66/division66.html) at [BAM (Federal Institute of Materials Research and Testing)](https://www.bam.de/Navigation/EN/Home/home.html). Some of us are affiliated with [Friedrich Schiller University Jena](https://www.physik.uni-jena.de/en/19855/institute-of-condensed-matter-theory-and-optics).

We work on Digital Materials Chemistry and Materials Informatics Topics. We regularly contribute to the Materials Project software and help maintain some of its codes: [pymatgen](https://github.com/materialsproject/pymatgen) and [atomate2](https://github.com/materialsproject/atomate2). Please find our development LobsterPy for automated bonding analysis here as well: [LobsterPy](https://github.com/jageo/lobsterpy)

We also heavily collaborate with the group of Volker Deringer at the University of Oxford. You can find our joint organization here: [autoatml](https://github.com/autoatml/)


Best wishes, 
[JaGeo on behalf of the group](https://github.com/JaGeo)
